    "Now that we've seen some of the pproperties of sampling at higher temperatures, let's explore a way to incorporate the improved exploration of the *entire pdf* from sampling at higher temperatures while still getting samples that match our distribution.  We'll use a technique called *parallel tempering*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The general idea of parallel tempering is to simulate $N$ replicas of the original system of interest (in our case, a single Metropolis Hastings chain), each replica at a different temperature. The temperature of a Metropolis Hastings Markov Chain defines how likely it is to sample from a low-density part of the target distribution. The high temperature systems are generally able to sample large volumes of parameter space, whereas low temperature systems, while having precise sampling in a local region of parameter space, may become trapped around local energy minima/probability maxima. Parallel tempering achieves good sampling by allowing the chains at different temperatures to exchange complete configurations. Thus, the inclusion of higher temperature chains ensures that the lower temperature chains can access *all* the low-temperature regions of phase space: the higher temperatures help these chains make the jump-over.\n",
    "\n",
    "Darren Wilkinson's blog post has a [good description](https://darrenjw.wordpress.com/2013/09/29/parallel-tempering-and-metropolis-coupled-mcmc/) of whats going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the idea that you must implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are $N$ replicas each at different temperatures $T_i$ that produce $n$ samples each before possibly swapping states.\n",
    "\n",
    "We simplify matters by only swapping states at adjacent temperatures.  The probability of swapping any two instances of the replicas is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A = min\\left(1, \\frac{p_k(x_{k+1})p_{k+1}(x_k)}{p_k(x_k) p_{k+1}(x_{k+1})}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the $T_i$'s in our set will always be 1 and this is the only replica that we use as output of the Parallel tempering algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "An algorithm for Parallel Tempering is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize the parameters $\\{(x_{init}, y_{init})_i\\}, \\{T_i\\}, L$ where \n",
    "    * $L$ is the number of iterations between temperature swap proposals.\n",
    "    * $\\{T_i\\}$ is a list of temperatures.  You'll run one chain at each temperature.\n",
    "    * $\\{(x_{init}, y_{init})_i\\}$ is a list of starting points, one for each chain \n",
    "2. For each chain (one per temperature) use the simple Metropolis code you wrote earlier. Perform $L$ transitions on each chain.\n",
    "3. Set the $\\{(x_{init}, y_{init})_i\\}$ for the next Metropolis run on each chain to the last sample for each chain i.\n",
    "4. Randomly choose 2 chains at adjacent temperatures.\n",
    "    1. Use the above formula to calculate the Acceptance probability $A$.\n",
    "    2. With probability $A$, swap the positions between the 2 chains (that is swap the $x$s of the two chains, and separately swap the $y$s of the chains .\n",
    "5. Go back to 2 above, and start the next L-step epoch \n",
    "6. Continue until you finish $Num. Samples//L$ epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**C1**. Explain why swapping states with the given acceptance probability is in keeping with detailed balance. The linked blog post might help.\n",
    "\n",
    "**C2**. Create a parallel tempering sampler that uses 5 chains at  the temperatures {0.1, 1, 3, 7, 10} to sample from $f(x, y)$.  Choose a value of L around 10-20.  Generate 10000 samples from $f(x, y)$.  Construct  histograms of the marginals, traceplots, autocorrelation plots, and a pathplot for your samples.\n",
    "\n",

    "We have new-found intuition about how to use temperature to improve our sampling. Lets now tackle the inverse idea: what happens if you sample at a lower temperature than 1. Our visualizations from Part B should indicate to us that the distributions become extremely tightly peaked arounnd their maxima.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we initialized a metropolis-hastings sampler around an optimum at a really low temperature, it would find us a local minimum. But if we had a higher temperature at the beginning, we can use Metropolis-Hastings sampling at high temperatures to travel around the distribution and find all the peaks (valleys).  Then we will slowly cool down the temperature (which will allow us to escape local optima at higher temperatures) and finally focus us into a particular optimum region and allow you to find the optimum. It can be shown that for ceratin *temperture schedules* this method is guaranteed to find us a global minimum in the limit of infinite iterations.\n",

    "We'll use this methd to find the global minimum of our distribution. The algorithm is as follows. Now we have only one chain, but we very slowly dial down its temperature to below T=1.\n",

    "1. Initialize $(x, y)_i,T, L(T)$ where $L$ is the number of iterations at a particular temperature. \n",
    "2. Perform $L$ transitions thus(we will call this an epoch):\n",
    "    1. Generate a new proposed position $(x, y)_{\\ast}$ using 2 independent gaussians with $\\sigma=1$.\n",
    "    2. If $(x, y)_{\\ast}$ is accepted (according to probability $P = e^{(-\\Delta E/T)}$, set $(x, y)_{i+1} = (x, y)_{\\ast}$, else set $(x, y)_{i+1} = x_{i}$  \n",
    "3. Update T and L \n",
    "4. Until some fixed number of epochs, or until some stop criterion is fulfilled, goto 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Delta E$ is the change in enery, or the change in the negative log of the probability function. That is, $E = -log p(x,y)$. For a given T and L, this is just Metropolis!\n",

    "This algorithm is called *simulated annealing* and we'll use it to find the global maximum for $f(X)$\n",
    "\n",
    "**D1**. Use simulated annealing with a cooling schedule of $T_{k+1}=0.98T_{k}$ and a L(T) defined initially at 100 with $L_{k+1} = 1.2 L_k$ to find the global optima for $p(x, y)$.  Plot $E(x, y)$ vs iterations.  Given how we constructed $p(x, y)$ it should be fairly straight-forward to observe the  true optima by inspection.  How does the optima found by SA compare to the true optima?"
